Steps for Json Server Setup

Step:1 ->  Run the Below Command to install json server on your machine
		npm install -g json-server 
		
		This will generate one db.json file which will be used for CRUD Operations.
		I have attached my db.json file replace your file with mine db.json as my db.json has all 		the data that is used in this application


        Important Notes: 

        db.json file has 3 objects
        1. login-> login data is used for admin login( admin don't have signup option in appp)
        2. signup-> Students signup and signin data is fetched from here
        3. notice- Add,Edit and delete is performed using this object

Step:2 : -> To run the Server use the below command
		   json-server --watch db.json



Steps To Run The Angular App


Step 1: -> Download the project with the GitHub link provided. 
		This will not have node modules but  thatâ€™s not an issue as all the package details are 		already available in package.json so it will download all the dependencies for you.

Step:2 -> I have used bootStrap 5 here for all the Styling so kindly check the bootstrap after 		setting up the project. 

		Note: I have not used a single line of css other than bootstrap in the project.

Step:3 -> This project uses angular routing, reactive forms,CRUD operations and Route guard.
		

I have also shared one google Drive link for Demo video of the project,Kindly check that.
